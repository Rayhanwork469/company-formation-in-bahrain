Setting up a company isn’t just about filling out forms and paying fees; it’s about understanding the landscape you’re entering. The good news is that Bahrain has made significant strides in simplifying these processes.
To start, you’ll need to decide on the type of business entity you want to establish.

Let’s face it: taxes can be a real buzzkill when it comes to running a business. But here’s where Sitra shines. The tax incentives available for businesses in Bahrain are among the most attractive in the region.
