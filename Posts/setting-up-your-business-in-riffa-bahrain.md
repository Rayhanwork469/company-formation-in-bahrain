[Starting a business](https://keylinkbh.com/starting-a-business-in-bahrain/ "Starting a business") in Riffa isn’t as daunting as it may seem, but you’ve got to be prepared. First off, you’ll need to register your business with the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism.   
  
This involves submitting various documents, including your business plan and proof of identity. It’s a bit of a process, but don’t let that scare you off! In addition to registration, you’ll need to obtain the necessary licenses specific to your industry.
