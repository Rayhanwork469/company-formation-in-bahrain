The business registration process in Muharraq is designed to ensure that all enterprises operate within the legal framework of Bahrain. However, the reality is often more complex than it seems.

From obtaining a [commercial registration](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/ "commercial registration") certificate to securing necessary licenses, the steps can feel overwhelming. In my experience, many entrepreneurs find themselves lost in a sea of paperwork. The initial step usually involves submitting an application to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism (MICT).
