Bahrain offers a variety of business structures tailored to different needs and objectives. If you're looking for flexibility and limited liability, a [limited liability company (LLC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp) might be your best bet. An LLC requires at least two shareholders and can have up to 50.
This structure protects personal assets from business liabilities, which is a significant advantage for many entrepreneurs. On the other hand, if you're planning to attract larger investments or go public eventually, consider forming a joint-stock company. This structure allows for more shareholders and can be either private or public.
It's worth noting that joint-stock companies have stricter regulatory requirements compared to LLCs. For those who want to operate independently, sole proprietorships are also an option, though they come with unlimited liability.
