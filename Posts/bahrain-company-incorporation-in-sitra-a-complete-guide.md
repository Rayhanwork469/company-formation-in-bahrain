When it comes to incorporating a company in Sitra, you have several options to choose from, each tailored to different business needs. The most common types include [Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp), Joint Stock Companies (JSCs), and Sole Proprietorships. Understanding these structures is crucial for making an informed decision.   
  
Limited Liability Companies are perhaps the most popular choice among entrepreneurs. An LLC provides personal liability protection, meaning your personal assets are safeguarded from business debts. This structure is ideal for small to medium-sized enterprises looking for flexibility and protection.   
  
On the other hand, Joint Stock Companies are suited for larger businesses that plan to raise capital through public offerings. This type of company allows for shares to be sold to the public, which can significantly boost funding opportunities. Sole Proprietorships are another option, particularly for individual entrepreneurs who want full control over their business.   
  
While this structure is simpler and requires less paperwork, it doesn’t offer the same level of liability protection as an LLC or JS. Each type of company has its pros and cons, so it’s essential to evaluate your business goals and choose accordingly.
