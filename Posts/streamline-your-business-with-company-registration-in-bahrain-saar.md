In Bahrain Saar, you have several options: [sole proprietorship](https://www.smeportal.bh/en/starting-a-business/choosing-a-legal-structure/), [partnership](https://www.smeportal.bh/en/starting-a-business/choosing-a-legal-structure/), or [limited liability company (LLC)](https://www.smeportal.bh/en/starting-a-business/choosing-a-legal-structure/). Each structure has its pros and cons, and your choice will depend on various factors like your business goals, the level of control you want, and how much liability you’re willing to take on.
