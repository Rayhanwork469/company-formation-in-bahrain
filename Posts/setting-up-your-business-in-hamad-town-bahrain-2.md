Whether you’re opening a retail store or a service-based business, being in a high-visibility area can significantly impact your customer base. When scouting for locations, consider factors like proximity to competitors, target demographics, and accessibility for both customers and employees.   
  
For instance, if you’re targeting families, being near schools or parks could be advantageous. On the flip side, if you’re catering to professionals, being close to business districts might be more beneficial. In my experience, visiting potential locations at different times of the day can provide valuable insights into foot traffic patterns and overall vibe.
