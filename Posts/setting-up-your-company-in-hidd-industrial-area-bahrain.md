### Registering Your Company

The first step is to register your company with the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism. This process involves submitting various documents, including your business plan and proof of identity. It's not as daunting as it sounds; just make sure you have everything in order.

When it comes to choosing a business structure in Bahrain, you’ve got options—each with its pros and cons. Whether you’re considering a [sole proprietorship](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soleproprietorship.asp), partnership, or limited liability company (LLC), it’s crucial to weigh your choices carefully. An LLC is often favored by foreign investors because it limits personal liability and allows for up to 100% foreign ownership in certain sectors.
