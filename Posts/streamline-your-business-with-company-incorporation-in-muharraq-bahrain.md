This involves checking the availability of your desired name and ensuring it complies with local regulations. After that, you’ll need to prepare the necessary documentation, which typically includes your business plan, proof of identity, and any relevant licenses or permits. Next up is submitting your application to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT). **They’ll review your application and, if everything checks out, issue you a [commercial registration](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/ "commercial registration") certificate.** This certificate is your golden ticket to officially operating your business in Muharraq.
