First things first: you’ll need to choose a business structure. Are you going for a [sole proprietorship](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure), partnership, or perhaps a [limited liability company (LLC)](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure)?

After that, you’ll need to gather all necessary documents—think identification, proof of address, and any relevant licenses or permits.
