Now that we’ve established why registration is important, let’s break down the process itself. It’s not as complicated as it sounds! First off, you’ll need to choose a business structure.   
  
Are you going solo as a sole proprietorship, or are you thinking of forming a partnership or a limited liability company?

This typically includes your identification, proof of address, and any relevant licenses or permits. In Tubli, the local authorities have streamlined this process to make it easier for entrepreneurs. You can often submit your application online, which saves time and hassle.
