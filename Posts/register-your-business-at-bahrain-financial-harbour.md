So, how do you get started with registering your business at Bahrain Financial Harbour? The process is relatively straightforward but requires careful attention to detail.

A well-crafted business plan not only helps you clarify your vision but also serves as a valuable tool when seeking funding or partnerships. After that, you’ll need to submit your application to the Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB).
