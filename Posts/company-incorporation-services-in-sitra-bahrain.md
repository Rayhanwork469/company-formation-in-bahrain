So, how do you actually go about incorporating your company in Sitra? The process may seem daunting at first glance, but breaking it down into manageable steps makes it much more approachable. The first step is to choose your company name.   
  
This might sound simple, but it’s essential to ensure that your chosen name isn’t already in use or too similar to existing businesses. A unique name not only helps with branding but also avoids legal complications down the line. Once you’ve settled on a name, the next step is to prepare the necessary documentation.   
  
This typically includes your business plan, identification documents for all shareholders and directors, and any other relevant paperwork required by local authorities. After gathering these documents, you’ll need to submit them to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT) for approval. This is where company incorporation services can be invaluable—they can help ensure that everything is in order before submission, reducing the chances of delays or rejections.

| --- | --- |
| Sole Proprietorship | A business owned and operated by a single individual, with no legal distinction between the owner and the business entity. |
| Partnership | A business owned and operated by two or more individuals who share the profits and liabilities of the business. |
| Limited Liability Company (LLC) | A business structure that combines the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation. |
